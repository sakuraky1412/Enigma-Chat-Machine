# HackHolyoke-2016
Java Project made by Kuan Chi Chen, Xijie Guo, Lu Shao, and Xuzhen Xiang

This is a simple coding application that can be used between two users, let's say, user1 and user2.

How to use

1. User1 inputs a password and a message. The application returns an encoded message in symbols.
2. User1 sends the encoded message and the password to user2 separately.
3. User2 decodes the message with the password provided by user1.

Why is it useful

Users may send coded messages to each other. People who do not know the password would not be able to decrypt the messages.

Improvements to be made

1. The coding algorithm can be made harder to break.
2. Other bug fixes
